#     Goal: This is the makefile to compile and run the 1D column model. 
#     Procedure: To compile the code, type 'make' which will create the+
#                executable file "Run_1DCol". 			       +		   +
#		 Afterward, type './Run_1DCol' to run the column model.+
#     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# The compiler used here is ifort. This can be changed based on the    +  
# working FORTRAN compiler
COMPILER = gfortran
#COMPILER = ifort
#COMPILER = g95
COMPOPTS = -r8 -g

column.o: column.f90
		$(COMPILER)  column.f90 -o Run_1Dcol

# To clean previous outputs for a new compilation, it is recommended   +
# that you type 'make clean' first. 				       +
# !!!! NOTE: This option removes all output files !!!	               +
clean:
	rm -f Run_1Dcol *.o fort.* *~ *.mod *.exe  Main core
